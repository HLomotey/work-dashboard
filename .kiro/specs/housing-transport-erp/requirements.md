# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive Housing and Transportation ERP system for BOH Concepts' hospitality operations. The system will centralize management of staff housing, utility cost allocation, transportation services, and related payroll deductions, transitioning from manual spreadsheet-based processes to a secure, scalable, and data-driven platform.

The primary goals are to enhance cost control, improve auditability, elevate employee experience, and provide real-time visibility into housing occupancy, transportation utilization, and associated costs across distributed hospitality operations.
